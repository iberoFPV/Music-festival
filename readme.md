# Rock & EDM Festival Project 🤘🎉🎸

Welcome to the Rock & EDM Festival Project! This exciting festival, blending the genres of rock and EDM, has been developed with passion and using modern technologies, including HTML5, CSS (with Sass), and JavaScript. We will explore how these technologies come together to create an interactive website featuring the event lineup, a visual gallery, ticket options, and more.

The Rock & EDM Festival is hosted online for you to experience all the excitement. Visit our website at the following link: [Rock & EDM Festival](https://music-fest-01.netlify.app/)!

Technologies Used 💻
The festival has been built with the following technologies:

- **HTML5:** We used HTML5 to structure the content of the website, ensuring a clear and accessible presentation.

- **Sass (CSS):** To enhance our design, we employed Sass, a CSS preprocessor. This allows us to manage styles efficiently, using variables, nesting, and other features that facilitate code maintenance.

- **JavaScript:** We implemented JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the project. From managing the lineup to form validation, JavaScript has enhanced the user experience. 💡💻🔧
